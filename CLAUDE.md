# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ReadyToSpendMonitor is a Python project aimed at productionizing a scoring model. The project will include:

- A robust API for model serving
- Containerization (Docker) for deployment
- Proactive monitoring for performance and reliability

## Current State

This project is in its initial setup phase. The codebase structure has not yet been established.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

Based on the .gitignore, the project uses Python with likely support for:
- pytest for testing
- mypy for type checking
- ruff for linting
- Django or Flask (both are referenced in .gitignore)

## Notes

- The README is written in French
- As of now, no build commands, test commands, or architectural patterns have been established
